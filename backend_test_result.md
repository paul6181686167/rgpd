    message: "All backend API endpoints have been tested and are working correctly. The MongoDB connection is also functioning properly. There are minor issues with error handling for invalid subscription IDs (returning 500 instead of 404), but these don't affect the core functionality. The backend is ready for integration with the Gmail API."
